No more bookers. No more Craigslist. No more middleman. 

Lyt is a curated booking concierge for venues to secure top local talent.

Venues can search and book artists and bands in their area.

Artists can search for other musicians with whom to collaborate.

Lyt puts talent directly into your hands.
